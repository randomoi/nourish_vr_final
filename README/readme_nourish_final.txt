Project Name: Nourish VR Experience for Managing Binge Eating

=====================================================

Unity Version 2022.3.11f1

EzySlice Library: https://github.com/DavidArayan/ezy-slice

=====================================================

Nourish is not intended to treat Binge Eating Disorder, as I am not a medical professional and cannot guarantee its effectiveness. I designed the app with the intention of moving the conversation forward about the need for VR applications to assist users in managing eating disorders outside of clinical research.  

=====================================================

Templates, Tutorials

The starting point of the project was based on "Fist Full of Shrimp" template and Unity Sample Scene. 
XR Setup is based on Unity Sample Scene. Welcome scene was partially based on "Fist Full of Shrimp" template. The scene transition is entirely based on "Fist Full of Shrimp" template. Additionally, Zenva mini degree was used as a guide for kitchen setup.

References:

Kitchen: model was edited by Bryan (former UoL student with 3D modeling skills). Stationary chairs were removed and kitchen was patched. Additionally, texture for the floor had to be edited as it had static shadows in the design file. I did that myself. I added separate 3D models for chairs to allow users to move them.
