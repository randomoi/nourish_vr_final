### **Project Overview**

Nourish is designed to simulate real-life scenarios where overeating is often triggered, offering users a safe and controlled environment to confront and manage their condition. It incorporates elements like guided breathing exercises, self-reflection, and nutritional education to help users build healthier relationships with food.

[Download APK](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/m0pub2tupdvh0f4104qiz/h?rlkey=jx4pmp6l4nn8ee7fwj4iz0oez&dl=0)

*Project was design in Unity Version 2022.3.11f1 and tested on Meta Quest 2 and Meta Quest 3.*

### **Features**

- **Immersive Environment:** The VR experience simulates social eating dynamics, offering a realistic yet safe setting for users to explore food-related triggers and responses.
- **Guided Exercises:** Nourish includes guided breathing exercises and self-reflective prompts to help users manage stress and cravings.
- **Nutritional Education:** The project provides nutritional information and educates users on portion control and healthy eating habits.
- **Accessibility:** The VR experience can be accessed from the comfort of the user's home or therapist's office, providing flexibility in therapy.
- **Therapeutic Focus:** Nourish offers a compassionate and judgment-free environment, encouraging users to build self-compassion and mindfulness.

### **Interaction Techniques**

- **Self-Reflective Messages:** Prompts that encourage users to think about their emotional state and food choices.
- **Pop-up Questionnaires:** Questions that assess users' responses to various food items.
- **Nutritional Information:** Display nutritional information on the health benefits or repercussions of various foods, allowing users to make more educated decisions.
- **Fullness Meter:** A tool to encourage portion control and combat overeating.
- **Breathing Exercises:** Guided breathing sessions to help manage stress and cravings.
- **Cutting Food:** An option for users to practice cutting food into smaller pieces for portion control.

### **Concept and Design**

The Nourish VR experience takes place in a kitchen as a birthday party is being prepared. This environment is brimming with various food triggers, including tempting items such as cakes,  donuts, sweets, and alcohol, in addition to healthier options such as fruits and vegetables. This scenario is intended to mimic a real-life situation in which overeating is frequently triggered. Users navigate through this environment, encountering pop-up messages that prompt self-reflection and guided breathing exercises. A fullness meter helps users understand portion control, and educational prompts offer nutritional information.

### **Target Users**

Nourish is designed for teenagers and young adults (ages 16-21) suffering from binge eating disorder. This age group is more open to digital platforms, making the VR approach engaging and relatable. Additionally, Nourish aims to be a useful tool for mental health professionals and dietitians as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for BED.

### **Domain**
- Health and Psychology
- Nutrition and Dietetics
- Behavioral Therapy and Rehabilitation
- Education and Awareness

### **Navigation and Simulator Sickness**

To navigate the VR kitchen, users utilize controllers with thumbsticks for movement. Given the potential for simulator sickness, various techniques are employed to minimize discomfort, such as gradual acceleration/deceleration and fixed reference points. 

### **Visual Style**

Nourish features a safe and welcoming environment with soft color schemes and calming illumination. The kitchen and food items are semi-realistic 3D models, and the sound design includes soothing voices and relaxing nature sounds.

### **Project Team and Collaboration**

Nourish aims to collaborate with medical professionals, including therapists and dietitians, to ensure the project meets the needs of those with BED. The goal is to demonstrate the potential of virtual reality in treating eating disorders and support a broader audience.
